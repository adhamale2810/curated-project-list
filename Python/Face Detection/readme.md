<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a python face detection model using openCV (python library). User can detect the number of faces infront of camera by running this script. Script uses `haar_face.xml` as a cascade classifier to detect the face. Script highlights the detected face area and put a text mentioning the number of faces detected.

### Concepts used

- [Python 3.0](https://www.python.org/doc/)
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
- [Haar-Cascade](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
